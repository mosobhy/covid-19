# Description of your idea
Firstly, the user has to register with his/her name, phone number, address and national ID number. Then, he/she will be transferred to the questionnaire pages. Based on the questionnaire answers, the user will get a score which would classify the user into 3 categories, low risk (green QR code), medium risk (yellow QR code) and high risk (Red QR code). According to the user result, a doctor from the MOH might need to contact/phone call those with a medium and high risk of having the disease to get further information about the case. If the doctor suspected a COVID-19 case after contacting with the user, the doctor would advise the patient to self isolate him/herself until a medical crew comes to his/her place for specimen collection or transferring the patient to the nearest isolation hospital. That would prevent the patient to go out by him/herself to the hospital which would expose many in the streets to the infection. By this way, we can reach suspected patients in their places easier to prevent the complication of the case and further spread of the disease. After medical examination, if the patient tested negative, the MOH can convert the code colour from yellow or red to green, and if tested positive, the code should be converted to red. the QR code saves all the user information like the age, name, address and the symptoms as well. So, the medical staff can always scan the suspected users QR code at the hospital for rapid data The QR code would be also helpful in reducing suspected users movements. For example, users with yellow and red code should not be allowed to move outside their cities until his/her medical case becomes stable and the code turns green again. The questionnaire opens regularly every 5 days after submitting the answer, so the user should answer the questions every fixed period of time to update his/her medical condition.

# Who will benefit from your idea?
This is going to help the medical sector to get required information about each individual without directly contact, using our online system to collect the data about the symptoms appearing on each case. In case of the suspected or infected cases, this is going to ease the process of taking the required samples to analyse. And also hinders the progressive spread of the infection.
